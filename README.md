# ChainLab Ventures

A project to launch a number of new blockchains.

This document is very much a work-in-progress, but aims to share the seed of an idea for feedback from the community.

## Synopsis

The Edgeware Lockdrop engaged the participation of ~10,000 addresses held by members of the Ethereum community. Collectively, these addresses locked nearly 1.2m Ether, which at the time of writing was equivalent to approximately US$207m. For more details on Edgeware's lockdrop, go to [the Lockdrop Participation Statistics page](https://commonwealth.im/#!/stats/edgeware).

This project aims to use the Edgeware Lockdrop dataset to generate a number of different genesis states for Substrate and Cosmos based blockchains, with the initial distribution tailored to a specific audience who are most likely to want to engage in validating and evolving software for that chain.

The project seeks to publish a number of recipes for how to launch these chains using Edgeware's "self-improving" software (which might not be 100% ready yet, but then what exactly is these days?) and also using CosmosSDK by Tendermint, as well as setting up places for people to meet and talk about it e.g. Telegram groups.

The project aims to do little in marketing, except to publish well-written summaries describing each chain's genesis state, and to publish the genesis ledgers of tokens - which will contain addresses of participants in Edgeware's Lockdrop.

The project will then monitor which chains gain traction, and may even choose to start validating some of them, and earn some early inflationary block rewards. Perhaps take a "founder's share" in each one, perhaps not.

Obvious examples:

- MonetaryPolicyChain (working title) tailored towards lockers / signalers in Edgeware who are also
  - DAI / cDAI / rDAI / lsDAI holders
  - MKR holders
  - Active participants in MKR governance processes

- GovernanceChain (e.g. ANT holders)

- GameChain (Loom Holders)

- EgalitarianChain (every address starts with the same number of tokens).
